# BotManager

This project is in very early development and properly not usable for your purposes.

There are many easy-to-use Discord bots out there. You can configure them over a website and you don't need to manually 
host the bot. That's excellent for non-developers. However, I always want to have full control over the software that
manages my server. I also want to have some programmable features. So I created this manager app that can be configured
and programed by a json file.
